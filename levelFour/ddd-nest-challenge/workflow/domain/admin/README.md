# Admin Sub Domain

This sub-domain refers to administration, where only admins are allowed to operate. Although, for the purpose of this challenge, it focuses solely on CRUD operations for admins, there is potential to expand this sub-domain to track and manage operations performed by them. This would justify the existence of a new entity, such as "Operation," within the domain, leading to additional cascading requirements, such as auditing and detailed control of admin actions.

However, to avoid unnecessary complexity that is not required by the scope of the challenge, this additional functionality will not be implemented. The goal is to keep the project aligned with the challengeâ€™s needs without overcomplicating it.
