# Solution for Dependency Inversion

This solution was implemented to use @Injectable() in classes that require dependency inversion. Although the project will not proceed with this approach, it will be kept here for documentation purposes.

Moving forward, we will utilize @Injectable() directly in our domain use cases to facilitate dependency injection. This approach aims to streamline our implementation and enhance the clarity of our code. this solution will be our primary focus.
